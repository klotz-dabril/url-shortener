# url-shortener

This is not an exercise on making production worthy things. This is
a toy. And yes, there is no need for a router and there are much better
alternatives out there but it is fun.

## TODO

- [x] Change the default branch from master to main.
- [x] Request method in router matches.
- [x] Forward url parameters to the actions.
- [ ] Some kind of persistence.
- [ ] Do something about those Text to String and back again, all mixed with
      regex, mess.
- [ ] The actual url shortening!!
