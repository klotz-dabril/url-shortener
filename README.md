# url-shortener

This is not an exercise on making production worthy things. This is
a toy. And yes, there is no need for a router and there are much better
alternatives out there but it is fun.

## ToDo
- [X] Change the default branch from master to main.
- [X] Request method in router matches.
- [X] Forward url parameters to the actions.
- [X] Some kind of persistence.
- [ ] Do something about those Text to String and back again, all mixed with
      regex, mess.
- [.] The actual url shortening!!
  - [X] Make it work with the record id as shortened url.
  - [ ] Redirect requests.
  - [ ] Better shortening mechanism.



## Wishlist
- [ ] Some way of composing routes.
- [ ] Actions as Readers.
